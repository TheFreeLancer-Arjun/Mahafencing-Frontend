                  Indian Fencing Federation progress Shri Rajiv Mehta, Secretary
                  of the Indian Olympic Association, took over the position as a
                  President of Fencing Association of India in 2017. Shri Bashir
                  Ahmed Khan of Chhattisgarh and Ashok Dudhare of Maharashtra
                  elected as secretary and treasurer respectively. Fencing
                  Association caught pace in the overall development in presence
                  of Shree Rajiv Mehta. His management, hard work, skill and
                  intense practice in sports have paid of. Many pending cases in
                  the sports ministry are resolved in a positive way such as
                  fencing up gradation in priority games; it is only because of
                  Shri. Rajiv Mehtaji, a large amount of funds raised to
                  participate in international competitions. At a time when
                  there was no funding from the central government, Rajiv
                  Mehtaji sanctioned the entire cost of players for
                  international tournament. The Olympic medal game was not in
                  the South Asian Games; with the efforts of Mr. Rajiv Mehata it
                  was included in the South Asian Games, Nepal. No major
                  international competition has been held in India yet, but due
                  to the efforts and initiative of Rajiv Mehta, India has been
                  given the title of Commonwealth Championship in 2020. Fencing
                  has gained a great reputation not only in India but also in
                  the world. All credit goes to Shri Rajiv Mehta for encouraging
                  the players. He also has taken initiative for involvement of
                  fencing in Railways and police games. Under the chairmanship
                  of Rajiv Mehta, the Fencing association of India is taking the
                  eagles ride. History of Indian Fencing Association Responsive
                  image Indian Fencing Association was founded in 1974,
                  recognized by Government in 1997 and affiliated to the Indian
                  Olympic Association. Sports Authority of India adopted this
                  game under its “Special Area Games Scheme” from 1989 to 1996.
                  One German and two Russian coaches were brought by Sports
                  Authority of India to reinforce the SAG
                  Scheme.Achievements-Despite lack of equipment, infrastructure
                  and sustained and proper training. The National ranking
                  fencers who had participated in international competitions in
                  the recent past ,have had modest performance.Notwithstanding
                  constraint of funds and lack of effective long term training
                  and non-availability of competent and qualified coaches of
                  international calibre and lack of international exposure, the
                  juniors and seniors who had participated in international
                  events are gradually ascending the ranking position, both in
                  international and regional events. The Association had been
                  holding National competitions in Sub-Junior (1999), Cadet
                  (2004), Junior (1992) and Senior (1986) categories, both for
                  boys/men and girls/women. During the last few years, with the
                  active role being played by the Association and National teams
                  participating in international events with creditable
                  performance etc., have perhaps prompted the International and
                  Regional Fencing Federations to request the FAI to host
                  regional and international tournaments in Fencing.
                  Organization of such international meets etc. will immensely
                  benefit the FAI, will give an impetus to the game in the
                  country, adequate exposure to the host team, acquire
                  popularity of the game, test our organizational ability and
                  give an opportunity to visiting teams to see our country etc

                  game under its “Special Area Games Scheme” from 1989 to 1996.
                  One German and two Russian coaches were brought by Sports
                  Authority of India to reinforce the SAG Scheme. During this
                  period the trainees had participated in the World Junior &
                  Cadet Championship in 1995 and the senior team participated in
                  training-cum-competition at Belarus and also in an
                  International meet at Tehran in 1996, where they secured a
                  bronze medal in each tournament. Owing to intensive training
                  in the SAG Scheme, all trainees became National champions in
                  their respective events, later. With the closure of the SAG
                  Scheme by SAI in 1996, the game became dormant. The
                  Association had been holding National competitions in
                  Sub-Junior (1999), Cadet (2004), Junior (1992) and Senior

                  SAI had been conducting the National Coaching Camp of a
                  limited duration at different venues. Streamlined the
                  functioning of the affiliated units and regulated the pattern
                  and conduct of competition in National Championships.
                  Established an office in J.N. Stadium, New Delhi, for
                  secretarial work. Created a website for the benefit of the
                  sports lovers. Started Diploma and Certificate Courses with

                  Course once in 1996 (Bangalore) and 2003 (Patiala). Complied
                  with all requirements of the IOA and SAI. Obtained the
                  services of foreign coach, for a period of ten months each, in
                  2002 and 2004 to impart training to National teams and advise
                  SAI on improvements to be effected. Achievement Despite lack
                  of equipment, infrastructure and sustained and proper
                  training, the National ranking fencers who had participated in
                  international competitions in the recent past, have had modest
                  performance. Notwithstanding constraint of funds and lack of
                  effective long term training and non-availability of competent
                  and qualified coaches of international calibre and lack of
                  international exposure, the juniors and seniors who had
                  participated in international events are gradually ascending
                  the ranking position, both in international and regional
                  events. The highlights are – the National Junior team both men
                  and women secured 5thplace in Foil event and one of the
                  members secured 6thplace in individual event on their maiden
                  appearance in the Asian Championship. Similarly, in the
                  Commonwealth Championship the Indian team secured 7thplace on
                  their debut. At the World level the juniors and senior
                  participants are gradually improving their ranking position in
                  the world competition, despite many constraints. The Foreign
                  coach who was here on a short spell of two different occasions
                  has prophesized that Indian fencers could do extremely well in
                  international competitions, subject to their sustained
                  training and concerted efforts on a continuous basis over a
                  period of time, keeping in view their inherent talent and
                  physiological attributes.
